         <p>I am currently in my third year of studying Computer Science at the University of Lagos (UNILAG). I am passionate about web and backend development and work with tools like <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, and <strong>Django Rest Framework</strong> to build web applications.</p>

        <p>Recently, I delivered a full website for a local real estate business and developed a backend system for a hospital appointment management application as part of a school project.</p>

        <p>While web development is my primary focus, I am eager to explore other areas within computer science as I continue to grow as a developer.</p>

        <p>Outside academics and work, I enjoy telling my story through technical writing. I also love reading Christian and theological works and learning about Western politics.</p>
