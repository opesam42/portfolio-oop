With a background in UI design and graphic design, I decided to find a real-world problem that I could tackle using the UX heuristics I had learned. During my search, I discovered the Yale School of Art website, a surprisingly awkward design for such a prestigious institution. Though this design was intentional, functioning as a community-editable wiki, I saw an opportunity to redesign the site and make it more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><strong>Design Process</strong></h3><p>The redesign process was applying UX principles and leveraging my skills in Figma.</p><ul><li><strong>Inspiration &amp; Competitor Analysis</strong>: I began by analyzing the websites of other art institutions in the US and UK.

My role was to lead the UI/UX design and user research, working closely with stakeholders to design the initial MVP of the platform.</p><h3><strong>Problem</strong></h3><p>Renting a home in Nigeria, particularly in student-dense areas, is fraught with challenges such as lack of transparency, inflated agency fees, and high legal costs. These pain points, identified through my research with students at the University of Lagos and renters in the surrounding areas, made it clear that there was a pressing need for a platform that could solve these issues.</p><h3><strong>Design Process</strong></h3><p>The design process kicked off with <strong>user research</strong>, both in-person and virtually, to validate the need for the platform. I identified transparency, affordability, and ease of use as the key focus areas for the platform\'s design.</p><ul><li><strong>Phase 1: Wireframing</strong>: I created wireframes focusing on the core user flows (home search, agent sign-up, and property details) to address user pain points.</li><li><strong>Phase 2: High-Fidelity Design</strong>: Using Figma, I translated the wireframes into high-fidelity mockups, applying <strong>minimalistic design principles</strong> to create an intuitive and functional user experience. Key features like reusable components ensured visual consistency across the site.</li><li><strong>User Journey Mapping</strong>: For complex features like the booking system and agent registration, I mapped out the user flow, enabling clear communication with developers and stakeholders.</li><li><strong>Prototyping and Handoff</strong>: The final designs were interactive prototypes in Figma, which facilitated a seamless handoff to the development team and helped illustrate interaction patterns.</li></ul><h3><strong>Solution &amp; Results</strong></h3><p>The result was a fully designed MVP for RENTIT that effectively addressed the key issues identified during the research phase. By focusing on a user-friendly interface, transparency in agent fees, and an accessible booking system, the platform directly addressed the most pressing pain points of renters and students.</p><p>The design has received positive feedback from early adopters, who have praised the clarity and ease of navigation.

For instance, users can go back to a previous step to make changes without losing their current progress.</li><li>JavaScript also handled price updates for add-on features. Prices were updated in real time when the user selected different subscription options.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Session Handling in Django:</strong><ul><li>On the backend, I used Django\'s session framework to store data from each step temporarily.

The form data was processed server-side, validated again, and saved to the database. To provide users with feedback, I also implemented a success email notification system using Djangoâ€™s built-in email functionality. This email is triggered once the form is successfully submitted and includes a summary of the user\'s subscription details.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Error Handling and Validation:</strong><ul><li>I implemented client-side validation for each step to ensure required fields were completed before proceeding. This included checks for valid email addresses and phone numbers.</li><li>On the server side, additional validation ensured data integrity and handled edge cases, such as missing form fields.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Session Data Handling:</strong> One challenge was ensuring data consistency across steps. I solved this by using session variables effectively, ensuring no data was lost if the user navigated between steps.</li><li><strong>Real-Time Price Updates:</strong> I had to ensure that the add-on prices reflected the selected subscription type (monthly or yearly). I used JavaScript to dynamically update the add-on prices as the user made selections.</li></ul></li></ol><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1097/582;\" src=\"uploads/success-min.png\" alt=\"Success screen\" width=\"1097\" height=\"582\"><figcaption>Success screen</figcaption></figure><p>This multistep form project showcases my ability to create complex, user-friendly forms that persist data across multiple steps.
